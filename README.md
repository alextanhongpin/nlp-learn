## Stopwords

List of stopwords: https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280

On dealing with stopwords: remove generic stopwords, but also don't forget to find the domain-specific stopwords. This is typically the name of the product itself, or verbs associated with the product, e.g. for computer games, the word `computer`, `game`, `playing` could be the stopwords, since it is describing the product itself.

## Text extraction

E.g. extracting keywords from resume. But there could be typo (e.g. workd, when what we want is work). Can levenshtein be used with regex? Apparently there is an approximate string matching regex in the regex module for python not the re module.
