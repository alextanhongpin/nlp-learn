## Topic modelling

Topic modelling is a machine learning and natural language processing technique for determining the topics present in a document.

Methods for extraction of topic models includes

- latent semantic analysis (LSA)
- probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)
- non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
